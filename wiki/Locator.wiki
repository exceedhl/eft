#summary window and control locator syntax

= Introduction =

Eft uses CSS selector syntax to locate windows and controls of the Windows application with little difference. Here list the supported selector types and the difference with W3C standard selectors.


= Supported Selectors =
== Universal selector ==
{{{
* select all elements of the application
}}}
==Type selector==
{{{
E (eg.Button) select Element with control type E
}}}

==Attribute selector==
{{{
E[foo='content like 'this''] select Element with control type E and attribute foo with the value "content like 'this'". 
So far supported attribute types are foo := className | name| id | text, and the attribute value can not contain "[".
}}}
==Id selector==
{{{
id selector is identical to [id='some id']
#id 
E#id 
E#'id with space \''
}}}

==ClassName selector==
{{{
Class selector is identical to [className='class']
.class
E.class
E.'class with space and \''
}}}

*_Notice:_ The value of id and class selector can not contain single quotes, if they do contain single quotes, use attribute selector syntax instead.*

==Structural pseudo class==
{{{
E:nth-of-type(n)
E:first-of-type
E:last-of-type
}}}

==Combination Selectors==
{{{
E F
E > F
}}}

=Differences with standard W#C CSS selector=
In eft:
* id and className can contain space and maybe other characters because the id and class name of window and control may contain space and other characters.
* Multiple controls can have same id(which is actually automation id).
