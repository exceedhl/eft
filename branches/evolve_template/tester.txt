<#|!|^|+>{Left | Middle | Right | XButton1 | XButton2 n}

pattern matching:
regex:regexPattern
exact:exactPattern
(default)glob:globPattern

Customized assertion:
* assert and assert_not
* assert and verify
* assert all properties

Wait action:
* wait related to all properties
* wait condition 
* wait changed

Tester:
* pattern matching - programmatic way using core
* action with scripting parameter
* assertion
 assertTextPresent, assertText, 
* More specific wait
* getter to avoid variable handling

Script:
* assert 
* wait
* action
* getter?

Proxy: 
* getter
* action
(error reporting)
- problems:
* once api changed in the core, we don't want to change many places(multiple client drivers, interpreter and proxy, Tester)
