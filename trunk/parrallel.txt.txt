AUT deployment(db preparation, network etc.) and trigger the tests to run
test deployment(nunit tests assembly or other formats? deploy tests to all machines or somewhere central? will tests be with AUT?)
test running coordination
result collecting
clustering?

how to migrate from single machine tests to multiple machines parallel?


defects of active controller(hub), passing commands from hub to agents:
* fixture setup/teardown problem - no commands can be created to accomodate complex setup/teardown scenarios

scripts/intepreter
using different language to write tests
parallel - test cases dispatch


parallel is very much like a mapreduce problem
the hub will actively control the agents, agents will probably only return result to the server
it's important to provide users a good interface to use(rather than letting them to glue different tools together to finish jobs by themselves)
